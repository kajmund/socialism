"""A changed contract needs a version bump for its *type*, not for being touched.

Two failure modes this gate must survive:

1. **Silent drift** — a journal field is renamed, the fixtures and manifest are
   regenerated, everything stays green, and every existing journal file is now
   misinterpreted.
2. **False alarms** — bumping `CONTRACT_VERSION` necessarily edits the file that
   also holds the journal codec, and regenerating a fixture changes example
   values. Neither may demand an unrelated journal schema bump.

So the gate works on **contract types** and compares a **per-file fingerprint**
of the wire form and public API, not paths:

    SWD form                      -> SWD_VERSION
    journal wire form             -> JOURNAL_SCHEMA_VERSION
    needs/evidence/operations API -> CONTRACT_VERSION

A type is "affected" when its fingerprint changed. Only an affected type needs
its version bumped. What counts as a change is deliberately narrow and
fail-closed:

* Every JSON value is compared. Renaming a key, changing a required list, an
  enum, a const, a pattern, a limit or any unknown scalar is a contract change.
* Example values are ignored only at **exact `(file, JSON pointer)` pairs**
  listed in ``IGNORED_EXAMPLES``. There are no global key names and no
  wildcards: an unnoticed scalar anywhere else still fails the gate.
* Values that embed a version constant are owned by that constant: they are
  listed in ``EMBEDDED``, checked against the owning constant's value at the
  same revision, and normalised to ``version:<CONSTANT>`` only when they match.
  A mismatch keeps the raw value (fail-closed). This is what lets a
  ``CONTRACT_VERSION`` bump regenerate the journal header without demanding a
  ``JOURNAL_SCHEMA_VERSION`` bump.
* A version constant's value is read from its **declaration**, using the same
  tokenizer as the API fingerprint, never from raw text: a comment or a string
  literal that merely spells ``JOURNAL_SCHEMA_VERSION = 2`` is not a bump. A
  missing or non-literal declaration still reads as "no version" and fails
  closed.
* The SWD schema keeps every semantic value (required, enum, const, pattern,
  bounds, refs); only its exact version location is normalised.
* Journal fixtures keep every ``kind`` value; example ids, timestamps,
  amounts/tariffs, actions, reasons, run ids and definition hashes are ignored
  at the frozen 11 entries' exact pointers. The SWD flow fixture keeps all
  values.
* Rust declarations are compared as whole declarations — including multi-line
  parameter lists with balanced ``()``, ``[]``, ``<>`` and ``where`` clauses,
  and struct/enum/trait bodies — with comments and string/char literals
  handled correctly. A signature that only changed on a later line is still a
  change.

Renames are diffed with ``--no-renames``: a file moved away from a frozen path
appears as a deletion plus an addition, and the deletion is a contract change
that needs the owning type's version bump (and a documented decision).

Every registered head version is validated before the "no contract path
changed" early return, independent of what the fingerprints say: if a
contract's files exist at the head, its version declaration must exist at the
head. Bootstrap may only excuse a *missing base value* (the first freeze, or a
package move in the same PR); it may never excuse a missing head declaration.

Bootstrap: while `contracts/` does not exist at the base commit, the initial
freeze may start at version 1 with a documented decision. The exception is
self-closing — once contracts exist at the base it can never apply again.

Editing `contracts/README.md` is documentation, not a contract change: the
structural test still pins every `*.json` fixture in `MANIFEST.sha256`.
