//! Generic operations: typed contracts, the execution gate, and the outcome.
//!
//! An operation declares the facts it requires. The engine decides, from that
//! declaration and the resolved need states, whether the operation may run.
//! This is the part that must not be negotiable: a policy may choose *which*
//! permitted action runs next, but it can never make an under-specified
//! operation executable, and an operation can never fall back to a partial
//! comparison.
//!
//! The domain supplies the executors (what an operation computes and how facts
//! are normalised). It supplies them through [`execute`], which keeps the gate
//! structurally in front of every executor.
