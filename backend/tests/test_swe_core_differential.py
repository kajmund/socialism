"""Differential tests: Rust is the only implementation of the semantics.

B2's acceptance criteria require that the same input produces identical
outcomes whether it is evaluated by the engine directly or by the Python
projection. Each case runs through `swe_native.resolve_evidence` (the engine) and
through the adapter's reader.

Following `docs/swe-standalone/13-verification-standard.md` requirement 1, every
case carries an **explicitly stated expected verdict** (`CASES`) and both sides
are checked against that literal. Comparing the adapter's reading back to the
engine payload it was read from would be a tautology: it could never detect a
divergence, which is precisely the regression these tests exist for — one need
becoming RESOLVED in Python and INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE in Rust.
