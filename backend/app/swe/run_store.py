"""Durable run-store contract shared by the SWE adapter and its implementations.

`app.swe.runtime` writes one `RunRecord` per transition and replays
`InvocationRecord`s on resume. `app.services.overgraph.workflows` implements the
contract, so the runtime stays independent of any persistence backend.

`WorkflowResources` is the other half of the same contract: the host-supplied
resources a run may use. It lives here so the durable-run types and the
injected resources are declared together.
