"""Projection between domain objects and the engine's generic core.

This module is deliberately thin. It converts domain data into the engine's
versioned wire shape, and reads back states the engine computed. It contains no
decisions: it never decides that a need is resolved, that evidence is ambiguous
or that a conclusion is insufficient. Those transitions belong to
`crates/swe-native` (see ``docs/swe-standalone/09-contract-decision.md`` §2).

Each payload carries ``schema_version``. An unknown version is a typed error,
never a silent interpretation.
